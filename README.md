# sf-movies-api
San Francisco Movies JSON API.

Based on [Uber coding challenge tools](https://github.com/uber/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/coding_challenge.md), to demo how to structure a Node.js api.

This API makes use of the [restify](http://mcavage.me/node-restify/) node.js module to building REST web services.
